Hello all!

1. This is a group project of DBMS Course (CS260) of our semester in IIT PATNA. We have made the training and placement portal of IITP which combines three domains viz. for Student, Alumni and for Recruiter.

2. The frontend is mainly coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and also contains some bootstrap. It has a clean and clear UI which enables every type of user i.e student, alumni or recruiter to browse through the website in hastle free manner.

3. Backend of the website consists of PHP in such a way that it connects the user to database server through MYSQL.

4. It has various features such as:
   (i) Studens can check for eligible companies according to their skill and company requirement.
   
   (ii) Also companies can select and filter out students according to their requirement and job roles.
   
   (iii) It also contains an alumni section where alumni's can provide their current and past job journey along with their other details like 			(company name, CTC, location etc.).
   
   (iv).Functionalities let user interact with the database. User-specific interaction induced. Only selected users
		like admin have special privileges, others have limited scope for smoother control and functioning.
